TODOS:
	Display search Results:
		Create a SearchResultsTableModel
		Create a SearchResultTablePanel
		Hook up the plumbing on search event
		
	Database
		Edit candidate already in database
	
	Advanced Search:
		Augment SearchEvent for individual query selectors
		Advanced Search Algorithm (Score based rather than just pure match, as it is now)
		
	Run Plumbing for/Augment Menu bar:
		import resume
		delete candidate
		
	Future:
		Email Candidate Functionality
		Switch Serialization to a sqlite database (should be easy if the API works to the model)
	
	Random UX: 
		Limit text areas (ex middle init)
		Option dialog if save but name not right
		check for duplicate candidates
		add sorting by column
		keyboard commands - delete key
